# The Register Serialisation Format

## Summary

This RFC aims to collect in one place the current implementation of RSF so it
can be added to the specification and it can be evolved with new RFCs when
required.

The Register Serialisation Format, from now on RSF, is an event log describing
the evolution of the Register data and metadata.

## Motivation

TODO

## Explanation

### RSF Grammar

RSF is a positional line-based textual format separated by tabs. Each
line defines a command to apply to a Register state to obtain the next state.

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as defined by
[RFC5234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) and refined by
[RFC7405](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7405). It assumes the following
definitions:

* RFC5234: `ALPHA` (letters), `CRLF` (carriage return, line feed), `DIGIT`
  (decimal digits), `HEXDIG` (hexadecimal digits) and `HTAB` (horizontal tab).
* Registers specification: [`CANONREP`][canon-rep] (canonical representation).
  Note that, in turn, it depends on [RFC8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

```abnf
log              = command *(CRLF command) [CRLF]
command          = add-item / append-entry / assert-root-hash

assert-root-hash = %s"assert-root-hash" HTAB hash

add-item         = %s"add-item" HTAB CANONREP

append-entry     = %s"append-entry" HTAB type HTAB key HTAB timestamp HTAB hash-list
type             = %s"user" / %s"system"
key              = alphanum *(alphanum / %x2D / %x5F)
hash-list        = hash *(list-separator hash)
hash             = %s"sha-256:" 64(HEXDIG) ; sha-256
list-separator   = ";" ; hash list separator

alphanum         = ALPHA / DIGIT

;                timestamp
timestamp        = date %s"T" time
date             = century year DSEP month DSEP day ; date YYYY-MM-DD
time             = hour TSEP minute TSEP second TZ ; time HH:MM:SSZ

;                date
century          = 2DIGIT ; 00-99
year             = 2DIGIT ; 00-99
month            = 2DIGIT ; 01-12
day              = 2DIGIT ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on month/year
DSEP             = "-"    ; date separator

;                time
hour             = 2DIGIT ; 00-24
minute           = 2DIGIT ; 00-59
second           = 2DIGIT ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap-second rules
TSEP             = ":"    ; time separator
TZ               = %s"Z"    ; timezone
```

### Media type

The current media type is `application/uk-gov-rsf`. It should change to
`application/vnd.rsf` to align with [RFC6838](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838).

### REST API

TODO

The current implementation uses `GET /download-rsf`. The main issue with that
is that diverges from the rest of the API where serialisation is expressed
either via suffix or via media type. The problem with using the same approach,
say `GET /register.rsf` is that we are not providing the same information when
querying `GET /register.json`.

What is a good name for a resource that represents the whole raw database?

```
# RSF

GET /{db resource}.rsf

GET /{db resource}
Accept: application/vnd.rsf


# JSON Lines — Hypothetical

GET /{db resource}.jsonl

GET /{db resource}.jsonl
Accept: application/x-ndjson
```

It is also possible to get a register patch in RSF:

* `GET /download-rsf/{n}`. Returns the RSF patch from the entry number `n`
  (non inclusive) to the most recent entry number.
* `GET /download-rsf/{n}/{m}`. Returns the RSF patch from the entry number `n`
  (non inclusive) to the entry number `m` (inclusive).

### Commands

#### <a id="assert-root-hash-command">`assert-root-hash` command</a>

Asserts that the provided root hash is the same as the one computed from the
current user entry log as defined in the [Digital Proofs][digital-proofs]
specification.

Note that the system entries are not part of the root hash computation and are
not asserted in any way.

##### Arguments

1. The `hash` of the root of the tree.

For example, the empty root hash:

```
assert-root-hash	sha-256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

#### <a id="add-item-command">`add-item` command</a>

Adds a new [Item resource][item-res] to the register. There must be at least
an [`append-entry` command](#append-entry-command) referencing the item's hash
later on to make the RSF patch [valid](#validation-rules).

##### Arguments

1. The [canonical representation][canon-rep] of the item.

For exeample:

```
add-item	{"country":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","official-name":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"}
```

#### <a id="append-entry-command">`append-entry` command</a>

Appends a new [Entry resource][entry-res] to the register.

##### Arguments

1. The `type` of the entry determines if the entry belongs to the data log
   (`user`) or to the metadata log (`system`).
2. The `key` of the entry. The primary key field is the field with the same
   name as the register.
3. The `timestamp` of the entry. This is the time at which the entry was
   appended to the register.
4. The `hash` of the item for which the entry was appended. This is the
   [sha-256 hash of the item][canon-rep].

For example:

```
append-entry	user	GB	2010-11-12T13:14:15Z	sha-256:08bef0039a4f0fb52f3a5ce4b97d7927bf159bc254b8881c45d95945617237f6
```


### <a href="validation-rules">Validation rules</a>

A RSF list of commands is expected to conform to the following rules:

* [Commands](#commands) are executed in order of appearance, top to bottom.
* User entries are numbered in sequence in order of appearance starting with 1
  if the register is empty, otherwise incrementing on the latest entry number
  found in the register.
* System entries are numbered in sequence in order of appearance starting with
  1 if the register is empty, otherwise incrementing on the latest entry
  number found in the register.
* An [`append-entry` command](#append-entry-command) must always appear after
  the [`add-item` command](#add-item-command) that introduces the item is
  referencing *unless* the item already exists in the register.
* It is illegal to have orphan items. An `add-item` must have at least one
  `append-entry` referencing to the item.
* It is illegal to have broken references. An `append-entry` must reference an
  existing item or an item previously introduced by an `add-item` command.
* It is illegal to have two identical consecutive `append-entry` commands.
* The item in the `add-item` command must always be in the canonical form.


#### Type checking

Although not part of the RSF specification, it is worth mentioning that a
Registers implementation is expected to type check the data according to the
computed schema.

##### Metadata

A metadata item must conform to the metadata schema

[TODO: This needs definition].

##### Data

A data item must conform to the current schema derived from the previous
system entries. A type checker is expected to verify:

* It has the primary key defined.
* Fieldnames exist in the schema.
* Cardinality is consistent.
* Datatype is consistent.

Given the example “[All commands in use](#all-commands-example)”, a new data
item is valid if:

* It has the primary key, `country` defined.
* It has at most one `name` field and one `official-name` field.
* The `country` field has cardinality 1.
* The `country` field is a String.
* The `name` field has cardinality 1.
* The `name` field is a String.
* The `official-name` field has cardinality 1.
* The `official-name` field is a String.

Each datatype must be parsed according to the [datatype specification][datatype-spec].

A RSF patch (set of commands) must be treated as a single transaction. If
there is a validation error, the whole patch must be rejected and any changes
to the state rolled back.
